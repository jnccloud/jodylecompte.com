Hi, I'm Jody LeCompte! I'm a full stack developer, SalesForce expert, and Google Certified Digital Marketer. Welcome to my little home on the internet.

## Development
My first love was writing code. It all began with a book on HTML targeted for kids, CSS followed a short while later, and eventually I settled into developing websites with PHP & MySQL. More recently, I focus on building apps using JavaScript with libraries like React, Gatsby, and Express. 

## SalesForce
I am versed in SalesForce administration as well as development using both declarative and code based platform development tools.

From custom fields, formulas, and workflows to classes, triggers, and processes -- I love how easy the SalesForce platform makes building an intelligent, effective, and scalable CRM to back your business.

## Marketing
I'm a certified digital strategist specializing in paid search. I understand the nature of people utilizing search engines to make their latest purchase and have mastered the art of placing the right ads in front of the right buyers.

I spend a lot of time working in both Google Ads and Google analytics as well as doing FaceBook and Twitter marketing. Some people like to try to coerce a sale from someone that doesn't want anything. I prefer help people find what they are looking for.
